## 🏁 Getting Started
This repository has two main goals: (A) introduce development of a specific cognitive basis to the public and (B) serve as the template foundation for a Knowledge Management System in a form of Obsidian Vault.
### 📎 Disclaimer 
The whole project is very much an attempt of philosophical reflection, so it should be taken with a grain of rational salt. Some argumentation may be rather subjective - the discussion is welcomed in GitHub Issues! :octocat:

# 💭 GRINDES - A Cognitive Basis 
> ***A 7-axis conceptual framework for structured thinking***

First of all - regarding [terminology](#Terminology) used, let's set the core declaration here. 
**Cognitive basis - 'a set of orthogonal, interpretable dimensions that structurally decompose cognitive processes’**
For this specific cognitive basis each axis/dimension:
- Encodes a primitive cognitive function with short description and operational verbs
- Maps into implementable activities and examples like scientific research stages and RPG stats for gamification of daily life
- Limits symbolism to metaphoric anchors only (no pseudo-science)
## 🎼 Ouverture
The table summarizes 7 basis concepts as columns and ideas / anchors arranged by rows. Click on any axis for a more detailed view (or check it ordered below).

## 📝 Notes

> **Original foreword from the draft human author (Sergei Abramenkov - it's me)**
> 
> Various math courses I had to take during university education did not stick in my head as fully and clearly as I would prefer. Still, I was really affected by a single simple idea presented throughout the major part of mathematics. To me it became the most important principle way beyond the math itself - it formed my outlook on any complex problem in general. Underlying concept for this principle/idea is called ***basis*** and that is exactly as it presented in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)): **a set of axis in a vector space that allows every element of that space to be written as a finite linear combination of these axis unit vectors**.
> 
> The root philosophical idea of making a personal cognitive basis had sparked during the second year of my postgraduate studies (late 2016). After years of struggling I somehow extracted it into the digital form and drafted 7 primary axis for my personal cognitive basis. Essentially I iteratively sorted and resorted out key actions, directions and dimensions of day to day life experience, then arranged it on a foundation of physics metaphors and linear algebra concepts. While I tried my best to keep the obtained cognitive basis vectors rather universal - this whole system is still very much subjective. Finally (only recently), I discovered that a Large Language Model may help immensely with the daunting task of organizing raw thoughts formed by human natural intelligence into concise and beautiful form. So together with **DeepSeek-V3**[^0] we co-designing an updated and much more coherent system presented here. 

### 📚 Terminology
The term "cognitive basis" is not a standard term in the field of cognitive science or psychology, but we can construct a meaningful definition by combining concepts from both cognitive science and linear algebra.
Alternative definition: a 'cognitive basis' can be understood as a set of fundamental cognitive structures or processes that serve as the building blocks for more complex cognitive functions. 
Just as a basis in linear algebra provides a set of vectors that can span a vector space, a cognitive basis provides a set of basic cognitive elements that can be combined to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena.
