# GRINDES - A Cognitive Basis 💭
> ***A 7-axis conceptual framework for structured thinking***

This project best described with a selection of specific perspectives:
- **For Scientific Research:** 
    "A usable vector space of cognition: 7 basis dimensions to decompose stages of a complex research workflow into actionable primitives."
- **For Creative Time-management:** 
    "A mental RPG system - stats and mechanics to gamify problem-solving in daily life."
- *For Philosophers - [contribute](#Contribute) with :octocat: to make your unique application case*
##### How to use this repository?
On a practical note, this repository has two main goals: 
- **(A)** introduce development of a particular cognitive basis to a broad community
- **(B)** serve as template for a Knowledge Management System in the form of Obsidian Vault

> [!TIP]
> **If you just want to have an Obsidian vault set up and running**
> 1. Download this repo as zip
> 2. Unpack it where you want your vault to be located
> 3. Run Obsidian
> 	- If you have another vault already open -> click `Manage vaults...`
> 4. `Open folder as vault` -> navigate to the location of unzipped repo
> 5. Use this cognitive basis to organize your notes or adjust it to your taste! 

> [!NOTE]
> **If you using GitHub (for syncing your vault)**
> 1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository
> 2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**
> 3. Select **Create a new repository**
> 4. Choose the right **Owner** and **Visibility** (ex. personal private) 
> 5. Type your repository name and add an optional description
> 6. Create repository from template**
> 7. Use your fresh repository the way you want it (open as Obsidian vault)!
##### What is a cognitive basis?
First of all - regarding wording used, let's set the core declaration here. The phrase 'cognitive basis' is not a standard term in neurobiology or psychology domains, but [in my opinion](#Motivation) we can construct a meaningful definition by combining concepts from both cognitive science and linear algebra.

**Primary definition: Cognitive Basis - 'a set of orthogonal, interpretable dimensions that structurally decompose cognitive processes’**

*Alternative definition: a 'cognitive basis' can be understood as a set of fundamental cognitive structures or processes that serve as the building blocks for more complex cognitive functions.* 
*Just as a basis in linear algebra provides a set of vectors that can span a vector space, a cognitive basis provides a set of basic cognitive elements that can be combined to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena.*
## Ouverture
For this specific cognitive basis each axis/dimension:
- Encodes a primitive cognitive function with short description and operational verbs
- Maps into implementable activities and examples like scientific research stages and RPG stats for gamification of daily life
- Limits [symbolism](#Symbolism) to metaphors and archetypical links only

### Symbolism 
The whole project is very much an attempt of philosophical reflection, so it should be taken with a grain of rational salt. Some argumentation may be rather subjective - constructive criticism is very welcomed in GitHub Discussions!
> [!CAUTION]
> **Disclaimer**
> Professional employment at scientific research institutes and programming/engineering experience shaped me to reject any smell of pseudo-science. Thus, a more objective part presented above should be considered the cognitive basis core.
> Symbolism presented in the section below is a particularly tricky part as it contains much more subjective view dictated by my innate passion for learning languages and cultures outside my native one. Being a significant part of my personal cognition, it obviously affected development of this basis. However, it should be viewed as a supplementary information - useful to better understand minor reasoning factors, but avoiding unnecessary overreaching.

## Coda
### Motivation
> [!NOTE]
> **Foreword from the initial draft human author (Sergei Abramenkov, PhD)**
> 
> Various math courses I had to take during university education did not get stuck in my head as fully and clearly as I would prefer. Still, I was really affected by a single simple idea presented throughout the major part of mathematics. To me it became the most important principle way beyond math itself - it formed my outlook on any complex problem in general. Underlying concept for this principle/idea is called ***basis*** and that is exactly as it presented in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)): **a set of axis in a vector space that allows its elements to be written as a finite linear combination of these axis unit vectors**.

The root philosophical idea of making a personal cognitive basis had sparked during the second year of my postgraduate studies (late 2016). After years of struggling I somehow extracted it into the digital form and drafted 7 primary axis for my personal cognitive basis. Essentially I iteratively sorted and resorted out key actions, directions and dimensions of day to day life experience, then arranged it on a foundation of physics metaphors and linear algebra concepts. While I tried my best to keep the obtained cognitive basis vectors rather universal - this whole system is still very much subjective. 
Finally (only recently), I discovered that a Large Language Model (LLM) may help immensely with the daunting task of organizing raw thoughts formed by human natural intelligence into concise and beautiful form. So together with **DeepSeek-V3**[^0] we co-designing an updated and much more coherent system presented here. 
### Contribute 
> [!TIP]
> Since it is a GitHub template repo you can just use it to create your own fresh repository with a single commit history and all existing folder structure and few files like this README. 
> However if you want to contribute you are welcome to fork, make a branch and pull-request as usual, since it is still a GitHub repo after all. 
> I intend to make few branches that for example include specific Obsidian files like a custom css-theme.

If you found any ideas in this project worthy - do not hesitate, let me know what resonated! If you have decent confidence of what can be added/removed/modified - feel free to contribute to the template (but make sure to create a new branch before pull-request)!
